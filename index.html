        Death
        <br>
        ---------------------------
        <br>
        It wasn't how I expected myself to end, but you know, it could be worse.
        <br>
        This world isn't meant for me, I've not enjoyed most of my time here.
        <br>
        I've written a few personal messages to the people I care about down below.
        <br>
        ---------------------------
        <br>
        Father, I know I will cause you unimaginable amounts of pain, and for this, I am sorry. Please continue living after I'm dead, your life will not be much different without me. I took everything you gave me for granted, you gave me everything and I gave you nothing. I sincerely apologize.
        <br>
        To all of my closest friends, I wish you all a good life. You are the people that meant to the most to me, I hope you know that.
        <br>
        Roman, I enjoyed all the time I spent with you, you meant a lot to me. I'm sorry I barely saw you in person after covid hit.
        <br>
        Alex, you are one of the best people I've ever met. You are a good person, I hope you know that.
        <br>
        Austin, though we don't often speak, you also meant a lot to me. Same goes for Blake. Sorry I cut off communication for a year or two, but I did enjoy the time spent together after.
        <br>
        Josh, you really meant a lot to me. It was fun playing TF2 with you, I enjoyed it. Goodbye forever.
        <br>
        Candelle, you were a nice person to speak with. I hope I didn't stress you out venting to you in the past. You're a good person, I know you will make an excellent therapist if you continue to pursue being one.
        <br>
        Saturn, you also meant a lot to me. Sorry I've not recently spoken much with you, I do apologize for this. I enjoyed talking to you.
        <br>
        To Adam, Devin, Scarlet, Dylan and Doug, you are all amazing people. I very much enjoyed your company. I hope you can all once again become friends at some point, but this probably won't happen.
        <br>
        Dust, I don't know all that much about you, but you were a nice person to be around. I hope you find success.
        <br>
        Laika, I hope you are able to sort out your sadness and depression, don't end up like me. You're a very good person, though I don't believe you think so. I wish you well.
        <br>
        Agastya, Jishnu and all those friends I have not seen for so long, I hope you see this message. You were some of my favorite people and you will forever hold a special place in my heart. Thank you for all the good times we had many years ago.
        <br>
        To my mother, and your family, I hope you all die in a car crash. I really do hope so. (aside from Sam. he is the only good person in your family.)
        <br>
        To anyone I did not mention, it's probably because I rarely spoke with you and did not know you on a personal level.
        <br>
        And to everyone else reading this, sorry it had to end this way.<br>
        <br>
        ---------------------------<br>
        <br>
        It's crazy to think I'll be reduced to practically nothing once I'm gone. In not much time, I will live on only in a few lines of text marking my death. I've no legacy to leave behind, and so I will not be remembered. In the years to come, it will be as if I had never existed.
